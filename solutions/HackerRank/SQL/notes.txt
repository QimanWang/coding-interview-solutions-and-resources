Join types:


Cross join :
joins every row in table 1 with every row in table 2.
no need for any join condition or predicates.

SELECT
    t1.id, t2.id
FROM
    t1
CROSS JOIN t2;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Inner join: functionally same as join
join rows that have matching predicates in both rows.

SELECT
    t1.id, t2.id
FROM
    t1
        INNER JOIN
    t2 ON t1.pattern = t2.pattern;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Left join: Inner join plus all row in left.
what happens to all the left rows that dont have matching predicates?
it will fill it with null.

SELECT
    t1.id, t2.id
FROM
    t1
        LEFT JOIN
    t2 ON t1.pattern = t2.pattern
ORDER BY t1.id;

Right join is the same, but flipped.
